## Hi, I'm Brian.

I’m building a career in IT with a focus on support, reliability, and practical problem-solving.  
I care about doing things the right way, with patience, clarity, and consistency.

### What I'm Working On
- A structured homelab environment (AD, M365, Intune, pfSense, patching, and ticketing workflows)
- PowerShell for safe, repeatable automation
- Honest documentation that someone *else* could follow without guessing

### What I Value
- Calm thinking under pressure
- Clear communication
- Steady progress instead of burnout cycles
- Being someone teammates can depend on

### Background
I came into IT through hands-on troubleshooting with real users, not just theory.  
I’ve worked service desk / MSP support, especially in VOIP environments, where reliability matters more than buzzwords.

I like systems that are:
- Predictable
- Documented
- Easy to hand over to the next person

### Current Goals
- Complete Network+ and strengthen core fundamentals
- Build a clean, well-organized technical portfolio
- Grow into roles where I can mentor newer techs the way others mentored me

If you're here to look at my work, start with the homelabs folder.  
Everything there is intentional and designed to be read, understood, and improved over time.

Thanks for stopping by.
