# Hi, I'm Brian.

I’m building a career in IT focused on reliability, clarity, and doing things the right way even when it’s slower or less flashy. I like systems that are documented, predictable, and easy to support as a team.

---

## What I’ve Built Recently

I have been developing a structured Windows homelab to deepen my foundation in real-world IT support workflows:

- Active Directory Domain Services (lab.local)
- DNS configuration for identity resolution
- Clean OU structure (Users, Computers, Groups, Service Accounts)
- Standard and Helpdesk account separation
- Shared network folders with NTFS and share permissions
- Role-based access via security groups (no one-off permission creep)
- Group Policy-based drive mappings using item-level targeting

Each lab is fully documented with screenshots and step-by-step verification, so someone else could follow it without guessing.

---

## What I'm Working On Now

- DHCP configuration with dynamic DNS updates
- Continuing to refine documentation clarity and structure
- Studying for Network+ to strengthen fundamentals

---

## Upcoming (Not claiming these as done yet)

These are next in the roadmap, not listed as existing skill:

- M365 / Entra ID identity sync
- Intune device management
- Ticketing and change-control workflows
- pfSense firewall and VLAN segmentation
- PowerShell automation for repeatable admin tasks

I list these so you can see my direction, not as experience I already have.

---

## What I Value

- Calm thinking when things break
- Communicating clearly without jargon walls
- Steady progress instead of burnout sprints
- Being someone teammates can rely on

---

## Background

I entered IT through hands-on support roles.  
I have worked MSP support in VOIP environments where uptime, communication, and patience matter every day.

---

## If You're Here to Look at Work

Start in the `/homelabs` folder.  
Everything there is intentional, written to teach, and designed to be improved over time.

Thanks for taking the time to look.
